# TODO-LIST

## Urgent

- Cursor shall not be moved to area where inputs are not allowed, i.e., before the first line of the text, in the padding area of line number. 
- Create appropriate padding (line number, etc)
- Create scalable screen updating conditional mechanism

## Good to Have

- Replace reading file method with syscall
- Make `struct keyValue V` a const struct.
