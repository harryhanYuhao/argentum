# Argentum: A text-editor

## Choice of Name

The creator of this project holds awful respect to the popular text-editor vim, which, by coincidence, means strength, virtual, or abundance in Latin.

Cicero famously wrote 'nulla vis auri et argenti pluris quam virtus aestimanda est' in _Paradoxa Stoicorum_. (no quantity of gold or silver is valued higher than virtual) Such a hobbist's project in no respect may be regarded to hold strength paramount to that of virtual (virtus/vis), or even gold (aurum); thus it was only left with the name of silver (argentum).
